Create the dashboard for the Trello-like app (Tralala).

The dashboard page when scrolled

 

 The “Add another list” when clicked will actually hide the “Add another list” message and show the Add List form. However since that cannot be shown in a screenshot, the form has been shown in a separate screenshot. Similarly, when “Add another card” on a list is clicked, it will disappear and the Add Card form shall appear in its place – you will implement this after the sessions on JavaScript

 

Make sure to hover over clickable elements and give hover styles as seen in above page. For example, clickable elements become opaque (and darker) when hovered upon. Hover over home icon, add icon etc. – they will turn opaque (slightly dark background).

Again, as an example, the edit icon (pencil) appears when a list item is hovered upon.
